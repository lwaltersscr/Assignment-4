# Assignment 4: CMPS 301 Programming Concepts - Spring 2024

## Overview
This repository contains solutions to one problem assigned in CMPS 301: Programming Concepts for the Spring 2024 semester. The assignment involves creating a multiplication table in C++.

### Problem: Multiplication table
In this program, we implement functionality for a multiplication table. Users can select the range of numbers they want to multiply, view the table, and decide if they wish to choose more numbers. The target audience is math class students, mathematicians, economists, and accountants. It provides a multiplication table for anyone who is wanting to multiply numbers.

## Features
  - Prompt users to enter a starting range and ending range of numbers that they would like to create a multiplication table on.
  - Prompt the user to enter the starting range and ending range on the numbers that they wish to multiply on the multiplication table. 
  - Calculate total cost based on the selected gas type and gallons.
  - Display the multiplication table using a conditoinal statement.
  - Ask the user if they want to create another multiplication table.
  - Repeat the process if they say yes, thank them and exit if they say no.

## How to Run the App
   - Open the provided C++ project in Xcode or any C++ compiler.
   - Run the program.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to choose what range of numbers you want.
   - Select yes if you would like to try a different range, and no if you would like to exit.

## Output
- Sample Output:
    ```
    Enter the starting range for Multiplication Table: 1
    Enter the ending range for Multiplication Table: 5
    Enter the starting range for multiplying the numbers in Multiplication Table: 2
    Enter the ending range for multiplying the numbers in Multiplication Table: 6
    
    Here is the multiplication table for 1 to 5 in the range of 2 to 6
    X 1 2 3 4 5
    2 2 4 6 8 10
    3 3 6 9 12 15
    4 4 8 12 16 20
    5 5 10 15 20 25
    6 6 12 18 24 30

    Do you want to create another multiplication table (y/n): ___

    Thank you for using the multiplication table generator.
